# Carmen- A repository of geopgraphic regions

## A Little History

Carmen began its life as a replacement for Rails' country_select and
state_select helpers. The API of the library was designed to facilitate
a few view helpers and model validations, and that was about it.

## Today

It's been a few years since Carmen was released, and it has been used by
on a lot of projects. Many fine individuals have contributed code and
data.

I decided recently that it was time to go back and rethink the library's
data model and API, and in the process address some long standing
issues. Carmen 1.0 will feature the following:

* A new, cleaner API
* Support for the old API via an optional require
* More complete data
* A sane approach to internationalization, utilizing an existing i18n
  library.
